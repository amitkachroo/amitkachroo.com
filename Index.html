        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Amit Kachroo, the General Manager at X Elevators, a dynamic startup dedicated to revolutionizing the elevator industry. With over 10 years of experience in operations and management, I bring a deep understanding of the intricacies involved in delivering innovative and reliable elevator solutions.</p>
        <p>My journey in the elevator industry began with a passion for engineering and a desire to improve urban mobility. After earning my degree in Mechanical Engineering from Tech University, I transitioned into leadership roles where I honed my skills in strategic planning, team management, and operational efficiency.</p>
        <p>At X Elevators, I oversee all aspects of the company’s operations, from product development to customer service. My focus is on driving growth, ensuring quality, and fostering a culture of innovation. Under my leadership, we’ve successfully launched our flagship product, the EcoLift, which is now being used in commercial buildings across the country, positioning ourselves as a trusted partner in the industry.</p>
        <p>I’m deeply committed to sustainable practices and leveraging cutting-edge technology to create elevators that are not only efficient but also environmentally friendly. My goal is to ensure that X Elevators leads the way in providing safe, reliable, and eco-conscious vertical transportation solutions.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I’m an advocate for continuous learning and enjoy mentoring young professionals in the industry. When I’m not at the office, you’ll likely find me exploring new engineering innovations or spending time with my family.</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in learning more about our work at X Elevators or exploring potential partnerships, I’d love to connect.</p>
